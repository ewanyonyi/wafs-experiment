In this repository we will be showing multiple examples on how to use CrowdSec within container environments.

The idea is to show how to use CrowdSec in different scenarios, from the most basic to more complex ones. These examples can be used out of the box or as a base to build your own solution.

| Name  | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Standard](/basic/)  | Old example please read top of README.md |
| [Container Socket](/container-socket/) | Example reading logs from container socket |
| [Container Labels](/container-labels/) | Example reading logs from containers using labels as discovery |
| [Journald](/journald/) | Example reading logs from journald |
| [Swag](/swag/) | Example protecting SWAG |
| [NPM](/npm/) | Example protecting NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager Fork) |
| [NPMplus](/NPMplus/) | Example protecting NPMplus (Nginx Proxy Manager Fork) |
| [Caddy](/caddy/) | Example protecting Caddy |
| [ELK](/elk/) | Example reading logs from ELK stack (Logstash) |
